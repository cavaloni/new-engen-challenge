## Notes

The app uses React Hooks, the new API introduct in 16.8

## Improvements

Due to time, there are many areas of improvement that I wasn't able to get to. More than listed below, but the most notable are as follows

- Making color variables in css
- Extract api calls to happen in one place, rather than throughout different components
- Redux definitely would have been useful here, as there is some shared state between components
- I definitely would have liked to add tests
- Adding ID to palettes would have been it more safe and stronger
- Need to prevent 0 length cart adds.
- Highlight selected colors on main page
- good amount of code cleanup

- And many more... I spent a too much time on this as it is. Though it was fun.
